Build from source
-----------------

In order to build Smart Connector you need to install Leiningen first.
(Java 8 SDK is a requirement for both lein and Smart Connector, so it is
assumed to be already installed)

    mkdir ~/bin ; cd ~/bin
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
    chmod 755 lein
    ./lein
    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:ecelis/iridescence.git
    cd iridescence
    ./build.sh

I everything goes well run the standalone application and browse to
http://127.0.0.1:3000

    java -jar ~/iridescence/webui/target/webui.jar
