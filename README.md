# Smart Connector

This is a work in progress, some/many things might be broken or need
manual intervention to build/run. Please refer to README.md files within
each submodule directory for details. Modules can change name, split or
be deleted until we reach the first stable and fully functional version.

  * webui         - SmartConnector Web User Interface
  * adapter-db    - DB Adapter (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle)
  * adapter-mirth - Mirth Connect Adapter (WIP)
  * CirrusLoad    - Cirrus Adapter        (WIP)
  * hl7yaml       - HL7/YAML parser module (LIMBO) <-might be deleted


## Installation

Easier way to get up and running is by fetching the jar file from
http://maven.v3ctor.club/mx/com/ecaresoft/smartconnector/, run it and
browse to http://127.0.0.1:3000

    wget http://maven.v3ctor.club/mx/com/ecaresoft/smartconnector/smartconnector-latest.jar
    java -jar smartconnector-latest.jar

Build from source
-----------------

In order to build Smart Connector you need to install Leiningen first.
(Java 8 SDK is a requirement for both lein and Smart Connector, so it is
assumed to be already installed)

    mkdir ~/bin ; cd ~/bin
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein
    chmod 755 lein
    ./lein
    export PATH=~/bin:$PATH

Build the Adapters first, order does not matter.

    git clone https://github.com/ecelis/iridescence.git
    cd iridescence
    for i in adapter-*; do cd $i; lein clean; lein deps; lein install; cd ..; done

I everything goes well run the standalone web server.

    cd webui
    lein clean ; lein deps
    lein ring server
