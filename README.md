Build from source
-----------------

In order to build Smart Connector you need to install Leiningen first.
(Java 8 SDK is a requirement for both lein and Smart Connector, so it is
assumed to be already installed)

    git clone --recursive git@github.com:ecelis/iridescence.git
    cd iridescence
    ./build.sh

If everything goes well run the standalone application and browse to
http://127.0.0.1:3000

    java -jar ~/iridescence/webui/target/iridescence_standalone.jar


`build.sh` by default cleans and build Smart Connector, it also takes
the `clean` sub-command, to clean only.

Build User Manual
-----------------

The user manual is included in the `doc` directory, which is a clone of
the github wiki for the project. It is writen in markdown and can be
rendered to ODT and HTML with `pandoc`

    cd doc
    pandoc Home.md -f markdown -t odt -s -o User-Manual.odt
    pandoc Home.md -f markdown -t html -s -o User-Manual.html
