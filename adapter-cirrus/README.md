# Iridescence

Cirrus Adapter for Smart Connector

## Installation

    gradle clean
    gradle eclipse

  1. Open Eclipse
  2. Import CirrusLoad (File->Import->General->Existing Projects into
     workspace)

### Bugs

  * Some .jar dependencies should be fetched and untarred in the root
    directory /iridiscence before importing or building in Eclipse.
    Later these dependencies will be avaialble in a custom maven
    repository

  * build.gradle md5hash errors for mirth server jar
